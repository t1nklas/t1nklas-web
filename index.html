lost interest. ill be back sometime. love you guys.<br>
<br>
well explanation is: <br>
"i cant catch a break, problem after problem after problem stacking up.
either way i feel like i cant use tech without feeling stupid, either i use ai to solve those problems or i just give up. dont wanna reach out for help since ill seem stupid or sum.
plus mental health problems, etc. :')
i just need a break and a detox from dopamine. (probably wtv)"<br>
